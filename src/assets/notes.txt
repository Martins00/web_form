Randoms
whenever we use the  v-for property, we need a key that contains a unique property for the cycling of data.
This key has to be binded so it can keep track of the data that is being input

2-way data binding: v-model enhances this
In the sense that if we use normal binding, it will only bind it one way. V-model helps us with a two way bind.

v-model
It is for tracking our input.
we put it in the tag of whatever we want to track and make it equal to the name we give it in the data object.

Keyup
The key up event fires up an event whenever there is change or an event in an input field.
Using the Keyup.alt, fires the event, but does not include the key that we used to fire it.
For instance, if our fire key was , if we used @keyup.alt, it will fire the event we set to it, but it will not include the ,

The keyup is a keyboard event, and adding alt, makes it a keyboard event modifier.
